# PersonalPortfolio

This is my soon to be redeveloped personal portfolio website, so there are only templates for my projects to put in. There is also a blog component that sorts posts by category.

## Getting started

Steps:

1. Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/DomDomo/PersonalPortfolio.git`
2. Install dependencies with `pipenv install` and start the work environment using `pipenv shell`
3. Make a `.env` file in the example of `.env_sample` with the correct inputs
4. Run `python manage.py runserver` in the folder with `manage.py`
5. Go to http://localhost:8000/projects in your browser
